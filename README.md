The video2text script extends the concept of converting images to ASCII art by applying the same idea to video frames. Inspired by the creative challenge of transforming images into text-based art, this script was developed to take that idea a step further, allowing users to watch videos as dynamic ASCII animations. By processing each video frame individually and mapping pixel intensities to corresponding ASCII characters, the script creates a real-time, text-based version of the video that can be customized in width and displayed directly in the console.
